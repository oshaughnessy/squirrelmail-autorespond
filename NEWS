Version 0.5.2rc4 / Wed, Oct 22 2007
  - Added sftp, ftp/tls, and ssh support.

Version 0.5.2rc3 / Wed, Oct 17 2007
  - Added compatibility plugin back in, using compatibility 2.x now.
    It's only required for load_config() in setup.php.
  - Moved config.php to config.php.ex so that upgrades won't overwrite
    the old config.  Added config_local.php.ex, which is an example for
    config_local.php, which overrides anything in config.php.
  - Resolved another E_ALL warning from ar_ftp_put().
  - Fixed bug where aliases couldn't be removed from the vacation section.
  - Moved storage of forwarding address from a comment in .forward to
    squirrelmail prefs; .forward comments aren't recognized by the Courier
    local delivery agent.

Version 0.5.2rc2 / Wed, Sept 12 2007
  - Cleaned up a little bit of HTML formatting.
  - Changed Reset button so that it uses a translated string label.

Version 0.5.2rc1 / Wed, Sept 12 2007
  - Fixed some broken internationalization calls.  Thanks again into
    Gabriele Vivinetto for pointing them out and for the updated Italian
    translation.
  - Got rid of the silly ar_gettext() function.  The textdomain binding
    is much more sensible now.
  - Eliminated every E_ALL warning I could find.
  - Improved error reporting during FTP problems.
  - Fixed bug where trash_folder wasn't recognized during .forward scanning.
  - Added htmlspecialchars filter before outputting any user input.
  - Added support for setting the From header in the vacation message file.

Version 0.5.1 / Fri, Sept 7 2007
  - Improved conformance to recommended coding standards for plugins
    based on guidelines at http://squirrelmail.org/docs/devel/devel-2.html
  - Added automatic setting of From header in vacation file using the
    From address defined in the squirrelmail prefs.
    Thanks to Tomasz Witek for the patch.
  - Added Japanese translation, but having trouble getting it working.
    Thanks to Yasuhiro Suzuki for the translation.
  - Removed use of the compatibility plugin.  I'm told that the use of
    sqgetGlobalVar means this plugin will only work with squirrelmail 1.4
    and newer.  If anybody wants the compatibility plugin integrated
    back in, please let me know.

Version 0.5 / Wed, Sept 5 2007
  - Added internationalization and Italian translation.  Thanks to
    Gabriele Vivinetto for the suggestion, translation, and head start.
  - Added ability to pass alternate alias names to the vacation program
    at the request of a few people.
  - Added ability to wipe out the vacation reply cache at the request
    of a few people.
  - Added keep_by_default config option.  Thanks for Daniel Watts for
    the suggestion.
    

Version 0.4 / Fri, Jun 27 2003
  - Fixed a bug where a user couldn't leave on filtering if they weren't
    doing a forward or vacation response.
  - Added more comments to config.php, converted the examples from
    a qmail setup to postfix/sendmail.
  - Tried to avoid creating some unnecessary PHP log warnings.

Version 0.3 / Fri, Apr 11 2003
  - Tried to take care of all shortcomings when register_globals = Off.

Version 0.2 / Wed, Apr 09 2003
  - Initial public release.
